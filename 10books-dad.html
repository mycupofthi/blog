        Jamie’s Friday Night Feast
      </h2>
      <h3 class="banner__caption--name">By Jamie Oliver</h3>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        British chef (and father of five) Jamie Oliver is a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and he himself has built an empire with his approachable cuisine and twinkly-eyed charm. The plaid-wearing Naked Chef’s talent is in fashioning food as friendly and unfussy as he is. Oliver has also turned his celebrity to advocacy: in 2005, he launched a campaign, Feed me Better, introducing schoolchildren to healthier food. Oliver’s latest book, <em>Jamie’s Friday Night Feast</em>, is filled with toothsome, party-happy recipes—from his ultimate veggie lasagna to his hearty steak-and-stilton pie. “All I ever wanted was to make food accessible to everyone; to show that you can make mistakes—I do all the time—but it doesn’t matter,” says Oliver. This intent to play, to try things, with permission to sometimes fail, seems like sage advice when it comes to food and fatherhood.

      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        Stephen King’s <em>The Colorado Kid</em>e—a best-selling mystery and the inspiration behind the TV series Haven—makes a comeback in bookstores this spring, with this new souped-up illustrated edition. The story kicks off in typically grisly fashion with the discovery of a corpse off the coast of Maine, and continues to hemorrhage with horror and mystery, evoking all the twisty moodiness of Dashiell Hammett’s classic <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. The prolific King has published nearly 60 books (<em>The Colorado Kid</em> is his 52nd!) and is married to novelist Tabitha King. In this clan, writing is clearly a family affair. He looks to his sons Joe Hill and Owen King as his writing partners; together, they have collaborated on several short stories, novels and novellas.

      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        “You can be whatever you want to be, but that’s nowhere near as important as knowing that you can be exactly who you are,” writes Fredrik Backman, Swedish author, blogger and columnist, in his wise and intimate memoir <em>Things My Son Needs to Know About the World</em>. Backman, the New York Times best-selling author of <em>A Man Called One</em> (now being made into a movie starring Tom Hanks) is a father of two, and mines his own rich parental experience in this collection of insightful, tender and honest essays—part memoir and part love letter to his son. Backman takes us, with warmth and candor, through the heart-filling highs, the sleep-starved lows, and the endlessly bewildering firsts that make up fatherhood.

        Author, screenwriter, columnist and father of four Michael Chabon won the Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for his novel <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em>, and now turns his literary brilliance to another amazing adventure: fatherhood. Chabon’s collection of essays <em>Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces</em> pivots around an essay he originally published in the September 2016 issue of GQ magazine—about escorting his then-13-year-old fashion-maven son, Abraham Chabon, to Paris Men’s Fashion Week. The piece was a viral hit. The book’s essays, deftly pieced together with Chabon’s trademark magic, are a rumination—by turns funny and wise—on the meaning of fatherhood.

        Jimmy Fallon once said: “Everyone looks so much better when they smile.” Fallon’s book <em>Your Baby’s First Word Will be Dada</em> is guaranteed to make you look better. The comedian, actor, father of two and host of NBC’s <em>The Tonight Show</em> has created a brand of comedy as quick witted as it is warm-hearted, and he brings this delightful sensibility to his inaugural kids’ board book. When Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen had their first baby, Winnie Rose, Fallon determined that his daughter’s first word would be Dada. He penned this book in support of his campaign. (Winnie’s first word was Mama). Look for Fallon’s follow-up picture book: <em>Everything is Mama</em>.

Now, he’s set his extraordinary talents to the page with his literary debut: <em>Hindsight & All the Things I Can’t See in Front of Me</em>. The book, in trademark Timberlake style, evades the confines of categorization, with hundreds of candid images, along with musings, anecdotes, and reflections—on his childhood, his creative process, his artistic collaborations, as well as his family, and his (fulfilling yet challenging) role as father to son Silas Randall Timberlake.

In this picture book, Obama celebrates 13 trail-blazing Americans (including Jackie Robinson, Georgia O’Keefe and George Washington) for their needle-moving courage, artistry and individuality. Through this cast of heroes, Obama shares all the promise and hope of his own children. And with lovely illustrations by Loren Long, the book evokes all the potential of childhood.

              Dwyane Wade’s <em>A Father First: How my Life Became Bigger than Basketball</em> is a slam-dunk memoir about the challenges and triumphs of single dad-dom. The eight-time NBA All-Star, two-time world champion guard for the Miami Heat and father of three bravely chronicles his vulnerabilities and his failures—from a public divorce with his high-school sweetheart to his custody battle, to his mother’s drug addiction and his challenged relationship with his own father—along with his passionate devotion to his children. “We all make mistakes. There is no guide to being the best dad in the world. I tell my kids I am going to learn just as much from them as they are from me,” said Wade. True. Though the book is as close to a guidebook to the game of life—and superstar-fatherhood—as they come.

              Dr. Murray Howe, Gordie Howe’s youngest son, might not have followed directly in his famous father’s footsteps, but his hockey legend dad still inspired him to do great things—just off the ice. Instead of the Stanley Cup, Dr. Howe set his sights on the field of medicine, eventually becoming a sports radiologist. After his father passed, Dr. Howe was asked to write a eulogy, which inspired his book <em>Nine Lessons from My Father</em>. In it, he expresses what it was like losing his hero, while capturing his beloved father’s legacy in countless stories and sharing the wisdom he learned from his dad.
