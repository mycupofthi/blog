        The Foodie Mom
      </h2>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        Growing up, the kitchen was the heart of the home. It’s where the family
        gathered around the table to catch up on the day; where you baked that
        first batch of melt-in-your-mouth chocolate chip cookies with mom. Even
        now, you’ll often grab the kids and head to her place for Friday night
        dinner or an impromptu Sunday brunch with the clan. What better way to
        celebrate Mom than with a culinary experience that combines her two
        passions: cooking and family.

        Find her favourite cookie recipe from your childhood and invite mom over
        for a decadent afternoon of coffee and sweets. Or gift her that coveted

        you’ve both been eager to try and share time together in the kitchen
        testing out a new recipe (bonus points for laying out the necessary
        ingredients ahead of time). It’s the ultimate bonding time.

        Remember your first kiss? First heartbreak? First real job? Mom was
        always there to share in the joy, the sadness, the newness of it all.
        She helped you set up your college dorm room and checked in
        daily—pre-internet, pre-smart phone—to make certain you were taking care
        of yourself. Not much has changed. You may have your own children now,
        your own home to look after and a high-powered career, but mom is still
        only a phone call away. She continues to give all of herself—from
        offering advice to showing up at your door with a fresh pot of
        chicken-noodle soup—to ensure everyone is happy and well.

        while you spa.

        For as long as you can remember, mom was happiest in the garden. Nothing
        like getting your hands dirty in the great outdoors, she used to say
        (you’d instinctively roll your eyes during those teenage years). As an
        adult, you can finally appreciate her love of all things green. Show
        your admiration this Mother’s Day with a unique experience focused on

        Build a terrarium together (stock up on glass jars, rocks, pebbles, soil
        and small plants) or create personalized flowerpots that’ll add a
        welcome dose of colour to her home—just in time for spring. You could
        also gather the kids around and with mom’s guidance, have them plant
        some seeds to grow their own veggies, such as carrots and string beans.
        Mom and kids alike will share a sense of pride in what they’ve created.

        When it comes to fashion and design, mom is always one step ahead of the
        game. She was rocking leopard print long before Lady Gaga—and she
        practically invented the notion of hygge (chic-but-cozy blankets were a
        staple in your home). She’s your go-to source when it comes to books,
        and she has yet to steer you wrong. This is a woman who appreciates

        Now’s the perfect time to spend an afternoon playing Marie Kondo with
        mom. Head to her house to give her closet a spring cleaning; have her
        try on her favourite pieces and curate the best looks, while deciding
        what to keep and what to toss. The best part? Coming up with fresh new
        ways to rework her wardrobe, then making a wish list of items needed to
        complete her look. Reward yourselves with a latte and stroll; sometimes
        the greatest inspiration comes from window-shopping and a meaningful
        heart-to-heart.

        Before yoga retreats were de rigueur and looking after ourselves became
        a hashtag (#selfcaresunday), mom knew the value of Me Time. ‘Take care
        of yourself to take care of others’ is her mantra—a lesson she has
        proudly passed down to her children. Honour her Zen-like ways with a

        you rarely get to explore. Our favourites have it all: wellness shops,
