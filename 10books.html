      <h3 class="banner__caption--name">By Rachel Hollis</h3>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        When Rachel Hollis, 36, posted an Instagram photo of herself exalting
        her stretch marks, little did she know it would go viral, inspiring
        countless women around the globe to flaunt their post-baby bodies with
        pride. Since that fateful post in 2015, the former event planner has
        launched a wildly successful career as a motivational speaker, podcast
        host and author (Girl, Wash Your Face was a New York Times bestseller).
        Did we mention she is also CCO of The Hollis Company lifestyle blog, as
        well as a mom of four? Hollis’ latest book,

        Why Not Me?
      </h2>
      <h3 class="banner__caption--name">By Mindy Kaling</h3>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        Actor, comedy writer and new mom Mindy Kaling has forged a career out of
        making people laugh, thanks to her brand of witty and punchy humour. The
        Mindy Project TV series garnered a cult-like following, while her 2011
        memoir,
        <a
          class="banner__caption-link"
          href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/is-everyone-hanging-out-without/9780307886279-item.html"
          >Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?</a
        >, was a New York Times bestseller.

          >Why Not Me?</a
        >, Kaling hilariously riffs on everything from wedding etiquette to why
        stars pretend not to like sex scenes to her love of McDonald’s breakfast
        sandwiches. It’s a fun read that feels like a conversation with a best
        friend—not surprising, given that Kaling has always had an accessible,
        every-woman quality to her.
