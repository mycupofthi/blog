        When Rachel Hollis, 36, posted an Instagram photo of herself exalting
        her stretch marks, little did she know it would go viral, inspiring
        countless women around the globe to flaunt their post-baby bodies with
        pride. Since that fateful post in 2015, the former event planner has
        launched a wildly successful career as a motivational speaker, podcast
        host and author (Girl, Wash Your Face was a New York Times bestseller).

      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        Actor, comedy writer and new mom Mindy Kaling has forged a career out of
        making people laugh, thanks to her brand of witty and punchy humour. The
        Mindy Project TV series garnered a cult-like following, while her 2011

          >Why Not Me?</a
        >, Kaling hilariously riffs on everything from wedding etiquette to why
        stars pretend not to like sex scenes to her love of McDonald’s breakfast
        sandwiches. It’s a fun read that feels like a conversation with a best
        friend—not surprising, given that Kaling has always had an accessible,
        every-woman quality to her.

      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        Pamela Druckerman has never shied away from bluntness. The Miami-born,
        Paris-based journalist writes candidly (#nofilter) about a variety of
        topics. Her acclaimed 2012 book, Bringing Up Bébé, touts the virtues of
        French vs. American parenting styles (the former sees toddlers sitting
        politely in restaurants).
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text indented">
        Now in her late 40s, with a daughter and twin boys, Druckerman tackles

        fashion choices. As expected, we have a lot to learn from the French
        attitude towards aging (hint: there is no clinging to youth).

        There are few things quite as validating for moms than knowing they’re

        A**holes: It’s Not Your Fault, but equally as relatable. In typical
        fashion, Laditan—a mom of three—shares both the joys and struggles of
        parenting with humour and grace.

                In 2016, LA-based comedians Kristin Hensley and Jen Smedley launched #IMOMSOHARD on Facebook—a web series aimed at
                giving social-media obsessed mothers reason to laugh. The mom duo quickly amassed millions of followers, leading to a
                successful Moms Night Out tour and a coveted pilot at CBS. Their highly anticipated new book explores the long list of
                expectations placed on parents and the value of mom friends who are there to share a glass of wine and help you deal,
                sans judgment.
