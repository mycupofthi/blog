        Tell us about your relationship with your mother growing up.

        “I am one of four children that were very close in age, and we all had a
        wonderful relationship with our mom. It was a relationship in a warm
        family, with a huge commitment from her to expose us to all of the
        things that she loved, including ballet, art, language, piano, dance and
        reading. At the same time, she was unintentionally blazing a trail. She
        was the original multitasker; a woman who could be a wife, a mother and
        have a career. And by virtue of how she did it, she created an example
        that said ‘It’s okay, you can do these things.’”

        How have your mother’s teachings inspired you to become the person you
        are today?
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        “She was, and still is, a role model in several ways. She reflected, and
        lived, a life where a woman could imagine having a family, being a wife,
        and having the ability to follow your individual passions. That notion
        that you could have a multi-faceted life was important. She has always
        treated me with respect—even as a child. She believes in treating
        everyone with kindness and respect, no matter who they are or what they
        do.”

        What values did you learn from your mother that you’ve passed on to your
        children and grandchildren?

        “Exposure to experiences and activities, and encouraging independence and respect. She made family gatherings and family
        time together central to our lives. My parents were role models by sharing the value of marriage and family. I
        experienced all of these things and I believe they hugely influenced the parent and grandparent I am today.”

        What advice would you give mothers raising children in today’s fast-paced, digital world?
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        “First and foremost as a role model, what you do, how you spend your time and how you are with others, that is, more or
        less, who your children will become. As much as everyday seems so busy, the time when our children are home with us is
        fleeting. Everything you invest now will pay in the future. Be conscious of the way in which you spend your time, as
        much as possible. Be present; be tuned in; be conscious.”

            What is one of your favourite Mother’s Day memories?
        </p>
        <p class="banner__caption-text">
            “One year when I was a teenager, I gave her a special framed card, which included all of the things I had learned from
            her—she still has it. But my favourite Mother’s Day ever was having my mom, my children and my grandchildren all
            together. These days my mom, who is 98, doesn’t travel so my favourite way to spend time together is to have a short
            visit or call, and then, if we can find ourselves in the same city, being with all of my kids and grandkids. Time
            together is meaningful, especially on Mother’s Day.”
