        Tell us about your relationship with your mother growing up.
      </h2>

      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        I am one of four children that were very close in age and we all had a wonderful relationship with our mom. Sibling
        rivalries notwithstanding, I grew up in a warm family environment with a mother who was passionate about exposing us to
        all of the things that she loved. This meant that, in addition to school, we took piano lessons, art and ballet class,
        we went to Hebrew school and were “recruited” to support her in whatever community project was her commitment of the
        day.
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text paragraph">
        I also remember her as being particularly non-judgmental, but at the same time quite strict about three things: manners,
        respect for others, and doing our homework well.
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-title default-text--transform">
        How have your mother’s teachings inspired you to become the person you
        are today?
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        My mother was, and still is, a role model in several ways. She was a highly engaged mother, a wife clearly committed to
        her marriage, and, once we were all in school, inspired to start a career. The notion that you could have a
        multi-faceted and rich life was perhaps her greatest life lesson.
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text paragraph">
        She also had these little maxims that she was fond of sharing, like: “If something is worth doing, it is worth doing
        well”; and “Don’t put off for tomorrow what you can do for today.”
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text paragraph">
      I also treasured that she has always treated me—and all her children—with respect—even when we were very young. She
      believes in treating everyone with kindness and respect, no matter who they are or what they do. To this day, anyone I
      come across who knows her or has met her, starts every conversation with, “Your mom is such a lady!”

        What values did you learn from your mother that you’ve passed on to your
        children and grandchildren?
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        Exposure to experiences and activities, and encouraging independence and respect. She made family gatherings and family
        time together central to our lives. With my Dad, she modeled what a wonderful marriage actually looks and feels like. I
        experienced all of these things and I believe they hugely influenced the parent and grandparent I am today.

      <p class="banner__caption-title default-text--transform">
        What advice would you give mothers raising children in today’s fast-paced, digital world?
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text">
        As much as it might seem when our kids are young that our time with them “under foot” is endless, the reality is, the
        time when our children are home is fleeting. So be sure to enjoy it and live it.
      </p>
      <p class="banner__caption-text paragraph">
        Also, as parents we are role modeling all the time. What we do, how we spend our time, how present we are when we are
        with our kids—these are things to be conscious of and do with intent. What we do is, more or less, who our children will
        become.

      What is one of your favourite Mother’s Day memories?
    </p>
    <p class="banner__caption-text">
      One year when I was a teenager, I gave my mom a framed card, which included all of the things I had learned from her. It
      makes me smile knowing she still has this card sitting proudly among the pictures of her children and grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="banner__caption-text paragraph">
      But my favourite Mother’s Day ever was having my mom, my children and my grandchildren all together. These days my mom,
      who is 98, doesn’t travel, so whenever possible I try to be in her city on that day.
